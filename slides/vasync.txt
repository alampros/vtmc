% node-vasync
% Observable Asynchronous Control Flow

* Written by Dave Pacheco (Joyent)
      ~davepacheco/node-vasync~ on github

* Similar in concept to ~caolan/async~, but with a focus
    on exporting current (and past) status to make
    it easier to understand the state of the system

* Provides a new primitive called ~barrier~: enumerate
    some set of ongoing operations (which you can add
    to), and get a ~drain~ event when they all complete

* Returns status objects that can be inspected in core
    files, or exported via web services or REPLs
